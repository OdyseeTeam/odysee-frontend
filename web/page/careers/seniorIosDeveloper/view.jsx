              <p>
                We are looking for an ambitious and self-driven iOS Developer to join our team. As a Senior iOS
                Developer, you will be responsible for designing and delivering the Odysee iOS app. Your role will be
                critical in creating an intuitive and user friendly user experience for all of the creators and viewers
                that use Odysee on iOS. At Odysee, you will be welcomed into a supportive and friendly (virtual) team
                and you will have the chance to lead many critical projects as they pertain to mobile. Odysee.com is the
                largest blockchain media platform in the world; after launching in December 2020, Odysee has been
                scaling significantly and is now looking to add a Senior iOS Developer with modern design aesthetics and
                who is an avid media junkie to its ranks.
