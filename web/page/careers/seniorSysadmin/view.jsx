                Senior Sysadmin @ Odysee
              </h1>
              <p>
                We are looking for an ambitious and self-driven Sysadmin to join our team. As a Senior Sysadmin, you
                will be responsible for deploying and maintaining the server infrastructure that Odysee uses. Your role
                will be critical in ensuring the needs of the team as well as maintaining order and stability so that
                the team can count on the infrastructure to run their software. At Odysee, you will be welcomed into a
                supportive and friendly (virtual) team and you will have the chance to explore and learn new skills.
                Odysee.com is the largest blockchain media platform in the world; after launching in December 2020,
                Odysee has been scaling significantly and is now looking to add a Senior Sysadmin who will be helping
                with the ever growing needs of maintenance on the infrastructure.
