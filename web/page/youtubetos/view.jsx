            <h3 id="toc_0">1. Overview of LBRY and the Services</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>“LBRY"</strong> is a decentralized, consensus-driven protocol that enables the publication and
              viewing of information, videos, music, data and other materials (<strong>“Content"</strong>). Content is
              distributed to LBRY by publishers and is stored in fragmented shards via a distributed network of
              third-party devices (<strong>“Hosts"</strong>) that utilize LBRY. LBRY also allows publishers to bid on
              and reserve names (<strong>“Names"</strong>), which can be used as a unique identifier for Content. Please
              consult lbry.tech to learn more about the technical architecture of LBRY.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              The Services provide an interface for you to interact with LBRY, including to publish, access, or host
              Content through LBRY. The LBRY protocol is not owned, operated, or maintained by us. We have no
              responsibility or liability for LBRY, and the Company has no ability to control third parties’ use of
              LBRY. We are not able to delete or remove Content that has been published through LBRY and that may be
              accessible via the Services.{' '}
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_1">2. Eligibility</h3>

            <p>
              You must be at least 13 years of age to access or use our Services. If you are under 18 years of age (or
              the age of legal majority where you live), you may only access or use our Services under the supervision
              of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a parent or legal guardian

              or omissions of such user in connection with our Services. If you are accessing or using our Services on
              behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that

              chargebacks or refunds, and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs

              metadata of the Content. Company, in its sole discretion, may from time to time impose limits on the
              ability to sell Content via the Services. Upon the purchase of Content, you and the purchaser of your
              Content will enter into a separate agreement, pursuant to which that purchaser agrees to pay the specified
              fees for the Content and you agree to enable access to your Content. You are solely responsible for
              providing refunds as required to comply with applicable law. You are responsible for determining what, if
              any, taxes apply to your sale of Content, including, for example, sales, use, value added, and similar
              taxes. It is also your responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct taxes to the

              communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any users

              Content. We are not responsible for any user’s access to your Content or any user’s misuse or

              device may be impacted due to the additional constraints being placed on it by the processing of Content.

            <h3 id="toc_11">12. Indemnification</h3>

            <p>
              To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
              Company and our officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the{' '}
              <strong>“Company Parties"</strong>) from and against any loss, liability, claim, demand, damages, expenses
              or costs (including attorney’s fees) (<strong>“Claims"</strong>) arising out of or related to (a) your
              access to or use of our Services; (b) your Content or any Name that you have reserved; (c) your violation
              of these Terms; or (d) your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another
              (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights). You agree to promptly notify Company Parties
              of any third party Claims, cooperate with Company Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs
              and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees). You
              also agree that the Company Parties will have control of the defense or settlement of any third party
              Claims. This indemnity is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other indemnities set forth in a written
              agreement between you and the Company or the other Company Parties.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                The Company and the other Company Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of
                liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any
                indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits, even if the
                Company or the other Company Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                The total liability of the Company and the other Company Parties, for any claim arising out of or
                relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater
                of any amount paid, if any, by you to access or use our Services or $100 USD.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>
                The limitations set forth in this section will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence,
                fraud or intentional misconduct of the Company or other Company Parties or for any other matters in
                which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do
                not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations
                or exclusions may not apply to you.

            <h3 id="toc_14">15. Release</h3>

            <p>
              To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release the Company and the other Company Parties
              from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and
              nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related
              to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.{' '}
              <strong>
                You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code § 1542 as well as any other
                statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only
                those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this
                release.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_15">16. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>
                Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and
                claims with the Company and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.
              </strong>
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_16">16.1. Binding Arbitration</h3>

            <p>
              Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively,{' '}
              <strong>“Disputes"</strong>) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims
              court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property,
              including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you
              and the Company (a) waive your and the Company’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising
              from or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and the Company’s
              respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding
              arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute
              and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a
              judge or jury in court).
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_17">16.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</h3>

            <p>
              Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and the Company
              and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration,
              class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or
              arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual
              or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative
              action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of
              individuals.
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_18">16.3. Federal Arbitration Act</h3>

            <p>
              These Terms affect interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 16 will be both
              substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal
              Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the <strong>“FAA"</strong>), to the maximum extent permitted by
              applicable law.
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_19">16.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</h3>

            <p>
              Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty
              (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute
              informally. Notice to the Company will be sent by e-mail to the Company at hello@odysee.com. Notice to you
              will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account. Your notice must include (a) your
              name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the
              nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and the Company
              cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the
              applicable party, then either you or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section
              16, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 17.1, file a
              claim in court.{' '}
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_20">16.5. Process</h3>

            <p>
              Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware. Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by
              a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (
              <strong>“JAMS"</strong>), which are hereby incorporated by reference. The state and federal courts located
              in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an
              arbitration award. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where
              you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.{' '}
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_21">16.6. Authority of Arbitrator</h3>

            <p>
              As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the
              exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute,
              including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy
              that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the
              authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
              The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one
              individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any
              proceeding involving more than one individual.
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_22">16.7. Rules of JAMS</h3>

              </a>{' '}
              By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and
              understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that
              the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_23">17. Governing Law and Venue</h3>

            <p>
              These Terms and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in
              accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles
              (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws
              of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to these Terms that
              is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or
              federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County,
              Delaware.{' '}

            <p>
              If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause
              or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any
              remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.
            </p>

            <h3 id="toc_25">19. Termination or Suspension</h3>

            <p>

              will prevent the spread or distribution of published Content through LBRY.

            <p>
              We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time upon notice to you. If we make changes to
              these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes by posting the revised Terms to the Services and
              updating the “Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. In some cases, we may provide additional
              notice to you, such as via our Services or to an email address associated with your Account. Your
              continued use of the Services following our provision of any such notice will confirm your acceptance of
              the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Services.{' '}

              These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company relating to your access to and
              use of the Services. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms. Under no circumstances
              may you assign your rights and obligations under these Terms, including in the event of change of control
              or by operation of law, without our prior written consent. The failure of the Company to exercise or
              enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. We
              will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or
              failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Except as otherwise provided in herein, the
